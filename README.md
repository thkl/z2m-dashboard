# Zigbee2MQTT Dashboard

Current Version:

[https://thkl.github.io/z2m-dashboard](https://thkl.github.io/z2m-dashboard) Note: This only works when your Z2M is behind a https proxy, because the page will be loaded thru https and your browser will not connect to a insecure websocket (ws)


For local deployment use the content of the dist folder an put it on a local webserver.
